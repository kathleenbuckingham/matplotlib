# matplotlib

The objective is to build a [Bubble Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart) that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, produce the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type

As final considerations:

* Use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
* Use the Matplotlib library.
* Include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* Use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles, Axes Labels, Legend Labels, Wedge Percentages, and Wedge Labels.
* Remember when making your plots to consider aesthetics!
  * Stick to the Pyber color scheme (Gold, SkyBlue, and Coral) in producing your plot and pie charts.
  * With the Bubble Plot, experiment with effects like `alpha`, `edgecolor`, and `linewidths`.
  * With the Pie Chart, experiment with effects like `shadow`, `startangle`, and `explosion`.
